# ⚡ FastHTTP-MCP Client – Async Python HTTP Client for MCP Tests / Services

FastHTTP-MCP Client is a modular Python project that implements an asynchronous HTTP client architecture with integrated MCP (Model Context Protocol) communication support.

The project demonstrates clean separation of concerns, structured logging, and extensible client design for interacting with HTTP-based services and MCP backends.

## 🏗 Project Overview

The project follows a layered, modular design:

- HTTP Client Layer – Handles HTTP-based communication  
- FastMCP Client Layer – Wraps MCP protocol interactions  
- Logging Layer – Centralized logging configuration  
- Example Script – Demonstrates usage and integration  

### Architecture Concept

The architecture separates transport logic from protocol logic:

Application Layer (example.py)
        ↓
Protocol Layer (fastmcp_client.py)
        ↓
Transport Layer (http_client.py)
        ↓
External HTTP / MCP Service

This design ensures:

- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easier testing & debugging
- Reusability of transport logic
- Extensibility for additional protocols

## 🎯 Purpose

This project explores:

- Asynchronous programming in Python
- Clean client abstraction patterns
- Structured logging configuration
- Protocol-to-transport separation
- Building reusable backend communication modules

It is particularly suited for backend communication systems, AI service integration, or microservice-based architectures.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Retry & timeout handling strategies
- Typed request/response schemas
- Integration tests
- Environment-based configuration
- Support for additional protocols
- Packaging as installable Python module

## 📚 Educational Context

This project is designed as a clean architectural example of:

- Layered client design
- Separation of transport and protocol logic
- Async I/O in Python
- Structured logging in production-style applications

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a technical and educational implementation.  
It is not production-hardened and should be extended with proper error handling, security measures, and validation before being used in a production environment.
